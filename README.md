# NextUp

NextUp is a mobile application designed to help users organize movies and TV series in one place, track episode progress accurately, and decide what to watch easily.

The app targets users who frequently watch content alone or with friends and struggle to remember what to watch next or where they stopped.

This project is developed as part of the CS526 – Mobile Application Programming course.
