Refactor the Settings and Edit Profile structure.

PROBLEM:
Currently profile editing options are duplicated:
- Edit button at top opens EditProfileScreen
- But Change Email, Change Password, Manage Avatar, Preferred Genres and Providers are also listed below.

This is redundant and not professional.

FIX THIS COMPLETELY.

------------------------------------
1) SETTINGS SCREEN CLEANUP
------------------------------------

Keep:

- Profile header card with Edit icon
- Log Out
- Clear All Data

Remove completely:

- Change Email
- Change Password
- Manage Avatar
- Preferred Genres (from Settings main page)
- Preferred Streaming Providers (from Settings main page)

All profile-related editing must exist ONLY inside EditProfileScreen.

------------------------------------
2) EDIT PROFILE SCREEN (Single Source of Truth)
------------------------------------

EditProfileScreen should contain:

- Avatar editing
- Name editing
- Email editing
- Preferred Genres selection
- Preferred Streaming Providers selection
- Change Password section

No duplication anywhere else.

------------------------------------
3) UNIFY BACKGROUND ACROSS APP
------------------------------------

Use EXACT same background as Settings screen for ALL screens:

- Home
- Search
- My Lists
- Friends
- Spin
- Edit Profile
- Any modal screens

Background style:
- Same dark navy gradient
- Same color tones
- Same glow intensity
- No beige anywhere
- No mismatched backgrounds

Create centralized background wrapper component:
AppBackgroundLayout

Wrap every screen inside it to ensure consistency.

------------------------------------
4) DESIGN RULES
------------------------------------

- Maintain dark premium theme
- White primary text
- Soft gray secondary text
- Emerald accent for active states
- Red only for destructive actions
- Rounded glass-style cards
- No UI duplication
- No unnecessary navigation rows

------------------------------------
5) FINAL RESULT
------------------------------------

Settings should feel clean and minimal.
All editing actions must be inside Edit Profile only.
All screens must share identical background style.
No mismatched themes anywhere.
