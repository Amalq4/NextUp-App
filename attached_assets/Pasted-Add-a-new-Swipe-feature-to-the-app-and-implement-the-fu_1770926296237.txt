Add a new Swipe feature to the app and implement the full flow as described below.

================================================

================================================

When user taps Swipe:

Open a new screen called:
Swipe to Decide

This screen must:
- Use the same background as all other screens
- Use centralized theme

================================================
SWIPE BEHAVIOR
================================================

Display one large centered poster card at a time.

Swipe RIGHT:
- Mark as Watched
- Automatically add to Watched list
- Show subtle confirmation animation

After LEFT swipe:
Store those titles temporarily for summary screen.

================================================
CARD DESIGN

Use existing theme colors only.
No neon colors.

================================================
FINISH BUTTON BEHAVIOR
================================================

At bottom of Swipe screen:
Add a button labeled “Finish”

When user presses Finish:

Do NOT go back to Home directly.

Instead open a new screen:
